To follow this course, make sure to be registered on our [Platform](https://www.motokobootcamp.com/).

## Welcome üëã

Welcome to the beginning of your Web3 adventure.

You've joined the Motoko Bootcamp, an elite recruiting programm for Web3 soldiers.

During this Bootcamp, you'll learn how to create a **DAO** (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) from scratch on the **Internet Computer** platform, using the **Motoko** programming language.

---

Why a DAO?

DAOs are a major innovation, changing governance. Just like the **steam engine** made the **Industrial Revolution** possible by harnessing **physical power**, **DAOs** harness **political power** and make a **Web3 revolution** possible. This could fundamentally change how we organize society and resources, with the end goal of creating a more stable, flourishing and collaborative civilization.

This future is only possible if enough builders learn how to harness the power of DAOs. That's why your goal, if you wish to earn your **Motoko Bootcamp Diploma**, is to build your simple DAO.
