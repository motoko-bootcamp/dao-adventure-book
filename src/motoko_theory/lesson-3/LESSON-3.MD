# Lesson 3: Primitive Types in Motoko.

Primitive types are fundamental core data types that are not composed of more fundamental types. <br/>

Primitive types are all the types that do not need to be imported before they can be used in type annotation.

<p align="center"> A few primitive types in Motoko</p>

## üî¢ Nat

`Nat` is used for **unbounded** natural numbers (1,2,3,4,...‚ôæÔ∏è). By default all positive whole numbers are casted to `Nat`.

```motoko
let n : Nat = 1;
```

Is equivalent to

```motoko
let n = 1; // Will be casted to Nat automatically
```

**Unbounded** means that value of type `Nat` will never [overflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN8i5cwjkSE). The memory representation used will grow to accommodate any finite number. Motoko also has the concept of **bounded** natural numbers (`Nat8`, `Nat16`, `Nat32`, `Nat64`) that we will cover later. If you try to assign a negative number to a `Nat` the program will trap.

```motoko
let n : Nat = -1;
```

This line will return an error: `literal of type Int does not have expected type Nat`.

`Nat` supports usual operations:

- Addition: you can add two numbers using the addition operator `+`

```motoko
let a : Nat = 1 + 1;    // 2
```

- Subtraction: you can subtract two numbers using the subtraction operator `-`

```motoko
let a : Nat = 10 - 2;   // 8
```

> Be careful with subtractions. `Nat` only plays with the positive numbers. If the result of the subtraction is less than zero, it won't fit. The value will no longer be of the `Nat` type and that could cause trouble if your program is expecting a value of the `Nat` type.

- Multiplication: you can multiply two numbers using the multiplication operator `*`

```motoko
let a : Nat = 10 * 10;  // 100
```

- Division and modulo: to divide two numbers, you can use the division operator `/` and to find the remainder of a divided by b, you can use the modulo operator `%`

```motoko
let a : Nat = 10 / 2;   // 5
let b : Nat = 3 % 2;    // 1
```

## ‚ûñ Int.

Integers represent whole numbers that can be positive or negative. The same mathematical operations seen earlier (addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, and modulo) can be performed on both `Int` and `Nat`.

```motoko
let i : Int = -3;
let j : Int = 5;
```

> Since `Int` includes positive and negative whole numbers it includes all value of type `Nat`. We say that `Nat` is a subtype of `Int`.
> `Int` is also an unbounded type and has bounded equivalents that we will cover later (`Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`).

## üö¶ Bool.

A `Bool` is either `true` or `false`. `Bool` stands for boolean and this data type only contains two values.

```motoko
let light_on : Bool = true;
let door_open : Bool = false;
```

Booleans can be used and combined with logical operators:

- `and`

```motoko
let result = false and false;   //false
```

```motoko
let result = true and false;    //false
```

```motoko
let result = false and true;    //false
```

```motoko
let result = true and true;     //true
```

- `or`

```motoko
let result = false or false;   //false
```

```motoko
let result = true or false;    //true
```

```motoko
let result = false or true;    //true
```

```motoko
let result = true or true;     //true
```

- `not`

```motoko
let result = not true;      //false
```

```motoko
let result = not false;     //true
```

`Nat` and `Int` supports comparison operators, which compare two integers and returns a `Bool`:

- The `==` (equality) operator which indicates if two values are equal.
- The `!=` (not equal) operator which indicates if two values are different.
- The `<` (less than) and `>` (more than) operators.
- The `<=` (less than or equal to) and `>=` (more than or equal to) operators.

```motoko
3 < 5   // true
1 >= 1  // true
1 != 1  // false
2 == 10/5   // true
```

> The `==` operator is very different from the `=` operator. The first will test if two values are equal while the later will asign a value to a variable.

## üí¨ Text

In Motoko, strings can be written surrounded by double quotes `"`

```motoko
"Hello Motoko Bootcamp!"
```

The type for string is `Text`.

```motoko
let welcomePhrase : Text = "Hello Motoko Bootcamp!";
```

We can use the concatenation operator `#` to join two `Text` together.

```motoko
let firstName : Text = "Motoko";
let surname : Text = "Bootcamp";
let completeName : Text = firstName # surname;
```

We can access the size of a `Text` by calling the `.size()` method.

```motoko
let name : Text = "Motoko";
let size = name.size()  // 6
```

## üî§ Char

A value of type `Text` is actually composed of values from another type: `Char`. A `Text` is the concatenation of multiple characters. Characters are single-quote delimited `'`

```motoko
let character_1 : Char = 'c';
let character_2 : Char = '8';
let character_3 : Char = '‚àè';
```

`Char` are represented by their [Unicode code points](https://deliciousbrains.com/how-unicode-works/). We can use the `Char` module from the Base library to check the unicode value.

```motoko
import Char "mo:base/Char";
import Debug "mo:base/Debug";
actor {
    let a : Char = 'a';
    Debug.print(debug_show(Char.toNat32(a)));   // 97
}
```

We can easily iterate over all the characters in a `Text`, by calling the `chars()` method. We can then use this iterator to create a `for` loop.

```motoko
import Debug "mo:base/Debug";
import Char "mo:base/Char";
actor {
    let name : Text = "Motoko";
    for (letter in name.chars()){
        Debug.print(Char.toText(letter));
    };
};
```

> Notice how when we iterate `letter` is a `Char` and we need to convert it back to `Text` to use `Debug.print` (learn [more here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/tutorials/developer-journey/level-1/1.2-motoko-lvl1/#printing-values)).
> The `Char` module also contains a few functions that can be used to test properties of characters:

- `isDigit`

```motoko
Char.isDigit('9');  // true
```

- `isWhitespace`

```motoko
Char.isWhitespace('a'); // false
```

- `isLowercase`

```motoko
Char.isLowercase('c');  //  true
```

- `isUppercase`

```motoko
Char.isUppercase('D');  // true
```

- `isAlphabetic`

```motoko
Char.isAlphabetic('|'); // false
```

## üí• Float.

`Float` are numbers that have a decimal part.

```motoko
let pi = 3.14;
let e = 2.71;
```

If you want to use `Float` for whole numbers, you need to add the type descriptor otherwise they would automatically be casted to `Int` or `Nat`.

```motoko
let f : Float = 2;
let n = 2;  // Automatically casted to type Nat
```

`Float` are implemented on 64-bits folowing the [IEEE 754 representation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ieee-standard-754-floating-point-numbers/). Due to the limited precision, operations may result in numerical errors.

```motoko
0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 0.3 // => false
```

```motoko
1e16 + 1.0 != 1e16 // => false
```

## üéõÔ∏è Bounded types

Motoko provides support for bounded types which are integer types with fixed precision. These bounded types can be useful for several reasons:

- Memory efficiency: Bounded types allow you to know exactly how much memory your data will occupy.
- Exact sizing: When you know that an API returns an exact number, you can use bounded types to ensure that the - returned number is represented accurately.
- Execution efficiency: If you know that your numbers require 64-bit arithmetic, using `Nat64` is more efficient than using `Nat`.
- Bitwise arithmetic: Bounded types make it easier to perform bitwise operations such as `<<` or `XOR` on binary data.

### Nat8, Nat16, Nat32 and Nat64

There are four natural types supported in Motoko: `Nat8`, `Nat16`, `Nat32`, and `Nat64`.

The number in the type name specifies the number of bits in the type representation. For example, `Nat32` represents a 32-bit natural number.

To declare a bounded variable, you must specify the type explicitly to avoid it being automatically cast to a regular `Nat`:

```motoko
let n : Nat32 = 1;
```

In contrast, if you declare a variable without specifying its type, it will default to a regular `Nat`

```motoko
let n = 1; // Will be casted to Nat automatically
```

### Int8, Int16, Int32, and Int64

Motoko also supports integer types, including `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, and `Int64`. Bounded integer types behave similarly to bounded natural types, except they support negative values. The number in the type name specifies the number of bits in the type representation. For example, `Int32` represents a 32-bit integer:

```motoko
let i : Int32 = -1;
```

## ü§ñ Blob.

`Blob` stands for Binary Large Object. The `Blob` type represents an immutable sequence of bytes: they are immutable, iterable, but not indexable and can be empty. <br/>

Byte sequences are also often represented as `[Nat8]`, i.e. an array of bytes, but this representation is currently much less compact than `Blob`, taking 4 physical bytes to represent each logical byte in the sequence.
If you would like to manipulate Blobs, it is recommended that you convert `Blobs` to `[var Nat8]` or `Buffer<Nat8>`, do the manipulation, then convert back.

## ü´ô Unit type

The last type we will mention in this lesson is the unit type `()`. This type is also called the empty tuple type. It's useful in several places, for example in functions to indicate that a function does not return any specific type.

```motoko
import Debug "mo:base/Debug";
actor {
    public func printMessage(message : Text) : async () {
        Debug.print(message);
        return();
    };
}
```
